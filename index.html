<p><strong>As far as I'm concerned, </strong>it's the best time of the year.</p>
<p>Spring's nice here, but I'll take <strong>October</strong> over <em>May</em> every time.</p>
<br>
<p>Western Maine's a part of the state that's mostly forgotten once the summer has run away and all those people with their cottages on the lake and up on the <em>View</em> have gone back to New York and Massachusetts. People here watch them come and go every year-</p>
<p><em>Hello, hello, hello</em></p>
<br>
<p>Goodbye</p>
<br>
<p>Goodbye</p>
<br>
<p><em><strong>Goodbye</strong></em></p>
<br>
