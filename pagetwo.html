<p><strong> In a small town,</strong> the opening of a new store is big news. It wasn't  as big a deal to Brian Rusk as it was to some; his mother, for instance. He had heard her discussing it (he wasnt supposed to call it gossiping, she had told him, because gossiping was a dirty habit and she didn't do it) at some length on the telephone with her best friend, Myra Evans, over the last month or so. The first workmen had arrived at the old building which last housed Western Maine Realty and Insurance right around the time school let in again, and they had been busily at work ever since. Not that anyone had much of an idea what they were up to in there; their first act had been put in a large display window, and their second had been to soap it opaque.</p>
<br>
<p>Two weeks ago a new sign had appeared in the doorway, hung on a string over a plastic see-through suction-cup.</p>
<strong> OPENING SOON!</strong>
<p>the sign read.</p>
<strong>NEEDFUL THINGS</strong>
<strong>A NEW KIND OF STORE</strong>
<p><em><strong>"You won't believe your eyes"</strong></em></p>
